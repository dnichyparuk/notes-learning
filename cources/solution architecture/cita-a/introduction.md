# Solution context
## System and context
We deliver solution in terms of technology to support business
System = colelction of
- components
- data
- processes
- etc
Becides system itself we should concider existance of:
- OM: Operating model - what busines actively does to solve the problem
  -  business processes
  - capabilities
  - everything to solve the problem
- BM: Business model - the reason why and what we doing to get money

They both drasticly impact the solution

This all existis in a buble - the complex bubble
Inside this buble there is a alot of stuf we don't control:
- culture
- society we live and deliver in
- market
- technology
- politics
it all cause presure
- it changes
- influences

System is valuable to it all
We can't build solution assuming everything this will not move!

SS doesn't control of oth that. But he reads and balances.

## Inside solution 
we have
- Data
- Software
 - business rules
 - processes
- Infrastructure

# Responsibilities
Business Architecture gives us
- EA Processes
- Emerging technology Standarts

SA follow project to Operations
We design systems that Operations would work with

# Solution lifecycle
We should not stick with the same methods. We should be fluent.

1. Selection phase (or Think) - evaluate potential profitability & risk
2. Selection phase map business metrics to valuation outputs
3. During the create phase (or Change) research existing corporate atterns, practices & standards
4. Create phase evaluate alternatives with cost-benefits and frame the best choice
5. Deliver phase (or Use) ensure value is generated through implementation of the plan
6. manage phase (or Review) - assess and communicate value delivered

## Details
### Think
- Create/review business case
- Calculate and communicate value
- Prioritize and select
- Assign architects  

### Change
- Capture and analyze requirements
- Architecture master
- Generic architecture
- Product specific architecture
- Architecture prototype
- Views/viewpoints

### Use
- Stakeholder communication
- Modify and update artifacts
- Delivery

### Review
- Review and analyze value
- Set architecture goals
- Update engagement model
- Communicate value
